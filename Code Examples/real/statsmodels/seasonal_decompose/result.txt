"""
    Seasonal decomposition using moving averages.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Time series. If 2d, individual series are in columns. x must contain 2
        complete cycles.
    model : {"additive", "multiplicative"}, optional
        Type of seasonal component. Abbreviations are accepted.
    filt : array_like, optional
        The filter coefficients for filtering out the seasonal component.
        The concrete moving average method used in filtering is determined by
        two_sided.
    period : int, optional
        Period of the series. Must be used if x is not a pandas object or if
        the index of x does not have  a frequency. Overrides default
        periodicity of x if x is a pandas object with a timeseries index.
    two_sided : bool, optional
        The moving average method used in filtering.
        If True (default), a centered moving average is computed using the
        filt. If False, the filter coefficients are for past values only.
    extrapolate_trend : int or 'freq', optional
        If set to > 0, the trend resulting from the convolution is
        linear least-squares extrapolated on both ends (or the single one
        if two_sided is False) considering this many (+1) closest points.
        If set to 'freq', use `freq` closest points. Setting this parameter
        results in no NaN values in trend or resid components.

    Returns
    -------
    DecomposeResult
        A object with seasonal, trend, and resid attributes.

    Notes
    -----
    This is a naive decomposition. More sophisticated methods should
    be preferred.

    The additive model is Y[t] = T[t] + S[t] + e[t]

    The multiplicative model is Y[t] = T[t] * S[t] * e[t]

    The results are obtained by first estimating the trend by applying
    a convolution filter to the data. The trend is then removed from the
    series and the average of this de-trended series for each period is
    the returned seasonal component.
