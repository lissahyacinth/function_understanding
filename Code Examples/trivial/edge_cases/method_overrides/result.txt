"""
Brief:
    Returns a list of all prime numbers less than self.n using a segmented sieve algorithm.

Parameters:
    None

Returns:
    list[int]: A list containing all prime numbers less than self.n.

Algorithm:
    1. Calculate the limit as the square root of self.n.
    2. Use simple_sieve to find all primes up to the limit.
    3. Segment the range [limit, self.n] and filter primes in each.

Example Usage:
    >>> obj = ClassExample(50)
    >>> print(obj.sieve_of_eratosthenes())
    [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
