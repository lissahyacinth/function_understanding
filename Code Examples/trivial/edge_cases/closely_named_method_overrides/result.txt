"""
Summary:
Returns a list of all prime numbers less than or equal to self.n using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

Parameters:
None

Returns:
list[int]: A list of integers representing the prime numbers less than or equal to self.n.

Description:
This method initializes a boolean list `primes` of length self.n + 1, setting all elements to True. 
It iterates through the numbers starting from 2 up to the square root of self.n. 
For each number p, if primes[p] is True, it marks all multiples of p as False in the primes list. 
Finally, it returns a list of all numbers that remain marked as True in the `primes` list, 
which are the prime numbers less than or equal to self.n.

Notes:
- The boolean list `primes` serves as a flag indicator for each number, denoting whether it is a prime (True) or not (False).
- The algorithm starts with the assumption that all numbers in list are prime.
- The method uses the property that a non-prime number must have a divisor less than or equal to its square root, optimizing the search for primes.
