# Leaderboard for Language Model Understanding [In Progress]

What I'm hoping this'll be is a way of understanding how different LLMs fare at understanding complex codebases.

Currently this runs 3 models; 

* GPT 3.5
* GPT 4
* XWin7B 

And evaluates their ability to create code documentation at a similar level to the existing documentation for real functions, 
as well as their ability to understand common code patterns in trivial examples. 

## Running the Tests
After install language_evaluator, you can run the tests with 

`python language_evaluator/__main__.py --example_directory="Code Examples"`

Installing [VLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) can speed this up greatly, although I 
don't presently having a working Windows example of this.

## Current Results
Currently this only returns the immediate comparisons for individual examples - it does not collate the examples into a 
single leaderboard.

## Example of current output;
